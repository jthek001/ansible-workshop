            <h2>Ad-Hoc Commands</h2>
            <p>An ad-hoc command is a single Ansible task to perform quickly, but don’t want to save for later.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Ansible ad-hoc commands is a good place to start to understand the basics of what Ansible can do before learning how to use playbooks &ndash; ad-hoc commands can also be used to do quick things that you might not necessarily want to write a full playbook for.</p>
              <p>Generally speaking, the true power of Ansible lies in playbooks. So why would you use ad-hoc tasks versus playbooks?</p>
              <p>For instance, if you wanted to restart a service on all of your lab nodes, you could execute a quick one-liner in Ansible without writing a playbook.</p>

            <p>An ad-hoc command can be used to do some tasks that you might not necessarily want to write a full playbook and save for later.</p>
            <p>This is a good place to start to understand the basics of what Ansible can do prior to learning about playbooks where the true power of Ansible automation lies.</p>
