          <h1>Writing Your First Playbook</h1>
		The playbook is where you can take some of those ad-hoc commands you just ran and put them into a repeatable set of <b>plays</b> and <b>tasks.

A playbook can have multiple plays and a play can have one or multiple tasks. The goal of a play is to map a group of hosts. The goal of a task is to implement modules against those hosts.
