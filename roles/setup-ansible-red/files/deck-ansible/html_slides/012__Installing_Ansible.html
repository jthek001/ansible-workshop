            <p>As open source, Ansible is freely-available thru numerous means and can be installed in minutes with only a few requirements that most system already have. The installation methods listed here are the most commonly used.</p>
            <p>Currently Ansible can be run from any machine with Python 2.6 or 2.7 installed. Python 3 support is in tech preview as of version 2.2. Windows isn't supported for the control machine.</p>
            <p>The requirements of nodes being managed by Ansible vary based on the type and access used to work with them. Ansible needs a way to communicate, which is normally ssh or winrm though other means such as RESTful APIs and specialized connection types may be necessary. Linux servers will need Python 2.6 or later. Windows serves need PowerShell 3.</p>
