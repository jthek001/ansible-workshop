            <h2>Tags</h2>
            <p>Tags are useful to be able to run a subset of a playbook on-demand.</p>
            <pre class="language-yaml"><code data-noescape>
- yum:
    name: &quot;{{ item }}&quot;
    state: latest
  with_items:
  - httpd
  - mod_wsgi
  <mark>tags:</mark>
     <mark>- packages</mark>

 - template:
     src: templates/httpd.conf.j2
     dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  <mark>tags:</mark>
     <mark>- configuration</mark>
            </code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>In the provided example, if the playbook were run with <code>--tags &quot;packages&quot;</code> the yum task would execute and the template task would be skipped. If the playbook were run with <code>--tags &quot;configuration&quot;</code> the opposite would happen. Without a <code>--tags</code> both tasks would execute like normal.</p>
              <p>Tags can be seen as a simple though specialized form of conditional statement designed to enable the execution of a subset tasks. Tags are a bit more than simple boolean flags though. To dig deeper see the <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_tags.html">playbook Tags documentation</a>.</p>
