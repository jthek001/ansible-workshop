            <p>Ansible is complete automation. It&apos;s not just configuration management, It&apos;s provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications, and orchestrating actions against all layers of IT infrastructure in a single tool.</p>
            <p>Ansible's capabilities allow you to orchestrate the entire application and environment lifecycle, regardless of where It&apos;s deployed.</p>
