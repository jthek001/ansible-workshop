            <p>Here is our previous example with a few slight modifications that have been highlighted.</p>
            <p>In this version of our example, we add a <code>notify</code> keyword to the first task to trigger a handler task if it returns &quot;changed&quot; as being true. The third tasks now is under a &quot;handlers&quot; section that signifies that the handler task will run on notification at the end of the play of change occurs during the first task.</p>
