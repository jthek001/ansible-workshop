            <h1>Demo Time: <br/>A Simple Playbook Run</h1>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>To demonstrate how an Ansible, open an SSH session to your control host and run the playbook in <code>examples/apache-simple-playbook</code>. That example playbook is essentially the same one we just examined.</p>
              <p>Don't forget to reverse what this playbook does before continuing to not interfere with later demos and workshops.</p>

            <h1>Workshop: <br/>Your First Playbook</h1>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>This assignment provides a quick introduction to playbook structure to give them a feel for how Ansible works, but in practice is too simplistic to be useful.</p>
              <p>See <code>workshops/simple_playbook</code> in the Ansible Lightbulb repo.</p>
              <p>Note: If your time is limited, this is a workshop you can skip. We'll cover this and more topics in the next workshop.</p>
