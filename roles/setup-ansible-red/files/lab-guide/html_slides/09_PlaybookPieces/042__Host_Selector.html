            <p>The Ansible play host selector defines which nodes in the inventory the automation is targeting.</p>
            <p>In this example, a single group of &quot;web&quot; is being targeted. Ansible supports targeting intersections, unions and filters of multiple groups or hosts though.</p>
            <p>For more details see <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_patterns.html">the host selector Patterns page</a> in the Ansible documentation.</p>
