              <h1>Demo Time: <br/>A Playbook Using Roles</h1>
              <aside class="notes">
                <p>Walk thru the site.yml playbook and the contents of <code>roles/apache</code> in <code>examples/apache-role</code>. Note how the tasks, variables and handlers from the basic Ansible playbook we've been examined and have been refactored into a role.</p>
                <p>Run the playbook on the control host. Notice anything different? Other than a few subtle display changes, you shouldn't. What's important is how roles let you better organize, share and reuse Ansible content that will be vital as the scope and sophistication of your automation accelerates.</p>

              <h1>Workshop: <br/>Your First Roles</h1>
              <aside class="notes">
                <p>Here students are tasked with refactoring their previous work from the Practical Playbook workshop into a role and modifying their playbook accordingly. We intentionally avoid introducing any new tasks or functionality otherwise. The objective here is to focus students specifically on how roles are structured and develop.</p>
                <p>You should emphasize the value of roles in better organizing playbooks as they grow in sophistication and making Ansible automation more portable and reusable than a basic playbook.</p>
                <p>See <code>workshops/roles</code> in the Ansible Lightbulb repo.</p>
