              <p>To demonstrate ad-hoc commands in action, open an SSH session to your control host and run the ad-hoc commands in the previous slides.</p>
              <pre class="language-yaml"><code>
$ ansible all -m ping
$ ansible localhost -m setup
$ ansible web -m command -a &quot;uptime&quot;

            <h1>Workshop: <br/>Ad-Hoc Commands</h1>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>This brief exercise demonstrates Ansible in-action at it&apos;s most basic and simple level. Thru ad-hoc commands, students are exposed to Ansible modules and usage and will apply to their understanding of tasks and playbooks. This exercise also begins to expose students to the concepts of Ansible facts and inventory.</p>
              <p>This workshop is also a good way to verify their lab environments are properly configured before going forward.</p>
              <p>See <code>workshops/adhoc_commands</code> in the Ansible Lightbulb repo.</p>
