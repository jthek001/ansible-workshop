              <p>The simple playbook we examined gave us a sense of the structure of a playbook and how they work, but in reality was too simplistic to be practical. Here we look at a basic playbook that it more complete to what users will commonly do with Ansible.</p>
              <p>Walk thru the site.yml playbook in <code>examples/apache-basic-playbook</code> and note the added logic and its function. Then, run the playbook on the control host.</p>
              <p>Don't forget to reverse what this playbook does before continuing to not interfere with later demos and workshops.</p>

              <p>In this workshop assignment students are tasked with developing their first complete playbook. The assignment approximates the tasks they will typical need to take in order to deploy and configure a single application service using Nginx.</p>
              <p>See <code>workshops/basic_playbook/</code> in the Ansible Lightbulb repo.</p>
              <p>Tip: Don&apos;t rush this workshop. Give students ample time to do this workshop themselves to completion. This workshop covers the essential concepts and features of effectively automation with Ansible and builds up their core skills for further exploration.</p>
