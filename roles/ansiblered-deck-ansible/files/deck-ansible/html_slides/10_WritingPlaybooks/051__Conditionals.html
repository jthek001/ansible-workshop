            <h2>Conditionals</h2>
            <p>Ansible supports the conditional execution of a task based on the run-time evaluation of variable, fact, or previous task result.</p>
            <pre class="language-yaml"><code data-noescape>
- yum:
    name: httpd
    state: latest
  <mark>when: ansible_os_family == &quot;RedHat&quot;</mark>
            </code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Conditionals are another instance of Jinja2 in action within Ansible plays themselves. In the provided example &quot;ansible_os_family&quot; is a fact variable Ansible will set.</p>
              <p>There are other forms of conditional clauses, but <code>when</code> is usually all that is needed.</p>
              <p>NOTE: Conditional clauses are considered to be raw Jinja2 expression without double curly braces.</p>
