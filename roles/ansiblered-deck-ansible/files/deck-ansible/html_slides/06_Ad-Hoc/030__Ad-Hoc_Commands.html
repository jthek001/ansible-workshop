            <p>Ad-hoc commands are quick checks on your servers that you donâ€™t want to preserve in an Ansible playbook.</p>
            <p>An ad-hoc command can be used to do some tasks that you might not necessarily want to write a full playbook and save for later.</p>
            <p>This is a good place to start to understand the basics of what Ansible can do prior to learning about playbooks where the true power of Ansible automation lies.</p>
